Desrciption:

The Bin5.0 is an auto-sorting Smart Sorter. This is thanks to our Smart Bin Sorter. With our Smart Bin Cap, we can transform any bin into a Smart Bin that is capable of sorting recyclable trash into three distinct groups - plastic, glass, and metal. It does it automatically for the user, so all they have to do is place their trash into the bin and it will sort it automatically for them. This was built using a Raspberry PI, motion sensors and Python.

The website was built using Python, it included features such as educational information, recycling statistics, a map to the nearest recycling bin and an image recognition feature that told you if an item was recyclable or not and how to deal with it.
