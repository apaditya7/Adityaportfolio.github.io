Desrciption:

Created several agents such as an  data analysis agent, a trading strategist agent, an execution agent and a a risk management agent to work together to analyse a stock, come up with a strategy to invest in it and asses it's benifits and risks.

Fed the the agentic system with tools such as a web scraping tool and a website search tool to give it access to the latest news about the stock. 

Inputted my budget, the stock preference and my trading strategy preference and the agentic system came up with a report highlighting a strategy recommendation, the risks and the advantages of investing in the stock. 

Utilised CrewAI, OpenAI's model and Python to develop the multi agent system.
