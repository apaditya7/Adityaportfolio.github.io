Desrciption:

Created several agents such as a venue coordinator agent, a logistics agent, a marketing agent to work together to plan an event and find out details such as an appropriate venue, itenary and marketing strategy.

Fed the the agentic system with tools such as a web scraping tool and a website search tool to give it access to real time data of the available venues.

Inputted preferences, guest list, theme and budget and the agentic system outputted a report highlighting an available venue that can accomodate the specified number of guests and match the theme.

Utilised Python along with CrewAI for this agentic system. LLama3 was used as the Large Language Model along with Groq as the cloud GPU.
