Desrciption:

Built a machine learning model for sentiment classification using Scikit Learn. 
Collected a list of tweets and cleaned and processed the data. Then performed tokenisation on the dataset. 
Built a pipeline to complete all the cleaning, transformation and tokenisation.
The pipeline was then used to build a Naive Bayes classifier Model that successfully classified the sentences into the appropriate sentiments.
