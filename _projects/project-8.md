Desrciption:

Utilised a pre trained transformer model from hugging face to develop a translation application. 
Built a pipeline and set it up as a function to accept an English sentence as an input. 
Built a gradio interface that allowed the user to pick between the language they want the sentence to be translated to and for the user to type in the English sentence. The output was then displayed on the user interface.
