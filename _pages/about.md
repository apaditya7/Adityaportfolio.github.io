Hey everyone I'm Aditya a 19 year old penultimate year computer science student at Nanyang Technological University. I picked up computing as a hobby in 2019 due to my previous interest in math and problem solving and have since fallen in love with the field, in specific it's application to data science and machine learning. 

My internship experiences include experiences working with, developing and deploying full stack applications, multi agent systems, advanced machine learning models and fine tuned large language models. I also engage in a lot of passion projects and certifications during my free time to really understand the field I aspire to be in. 

My hobbies include going for runs, playing football, and experimenting with new food. Find out more about my portfolio in the next few pages!!!
